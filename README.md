2D match 3 game mimics candy crush's gameplay and score/stars system, the game has number of levels and each level can
have one or more goals and the playe will progress through the levels by completing the required goals for each one.
The game's board can have any number of tiles in any formation and the game camera will always fit no matter what the dimensions are.
The game is made so there are no already done matches and the board will be reshuffled whenever a deadlock occurs.
The game has a hint system to indicate a possible move every 3 seconds.
There are different types of tiles ( normal, Locked, concrete and Honey).
The game will save the player's high score and number of stars in each level and also which levels are already passed and which aren't.

here is a video of the gameplay
